# How to use Understandings
This document will guide you through the how, why, and when of managing an Understanding system. It does not cover the root 'why' of why Understandings are neccessary.

## What they are
Understandings are a way to, in a standardised, non-taxon-specific manner, differentiate between multiple interpretations of the same taxonomic name. This is achieved by attaching further information to a traditional name e.g. Genus, binomial etc.

## What makes up an Understanding
Understandings consist of four parts:

- Name
- Author
- Year
- Count

### Name
The name of the taxon being referred to

### Author
The author of the Understanding

### Year
The year of the Understanding

### Count
An anti-worst-case measure to manage the incredibly unlikely possibility that two Understandings are created in the same year by people with the same last name and in the same team. For example 'Johnson, 2024' and 'Johnson, 2024'. In such a case, one would be given a `count` of 1, the other 2, entirely at the scheme organiser's/taxon expert's discretion.

### What are the author and years referring to
These are the author(s) of the work which created the need for a new Understanding, and the year in which it was accepted. The author and year of the *name* in the traditional taxonomic sense does not matter here.

## Geographic restrictions and why they are used
Understanding systems are strictly limited in geographic scope. For example, the BWARS Understanding system only applies to Great Britain, the Channel Isles, and Ireland. The restriction is due to the fact that the *confusions* that Understandings attempt to solve are regional.

### What is the best sized region?
The size of the regions that Understandings apply to are not fixed. Many factors influence the size of these areas, including

- The geographic spread of the taxa in question
- The distance that the taxa regularly travel in their lifetime
- The presence of other taxa with potential for confusion
- Funding
- Expert knowledge
- Willingness to collaborate

As a rule of thumb, the best size is 'as *large* as it can be before running into significant problems'. In order to know whether a problem is significant, ask a relevant expert. Larger systems require less administration but reduce flexibility.

### Different sizes for different taxa
Different taxa within a geographic range will often times prefer to work at different geographic range Understanding systems. For example, 'birds' might operate at a European level whilst 'aculeate hymnoptera' at a country level. This is entirely expected. The simplest solution is to not attempt to try to combine significantly different taxa into 'one solution' as, quite bluntly, there is very little gained and a whole lot lost by doing so.

## Resolving Understandings back to Types
It is possible to relate an Understanding back to a type, but there are certain steps to follow to ensure that this is done correctly. The first and most important is 'resolving'. 'Resolving' is the term used to identify what the current interpretation of a given Understanding is. The process is entirely analogous to resolving synonymy in traditional nomenclature, only applied to Understandings.

Once an Understanding is resolved, the `name` of the Understanding should match that of the current interpretation of the type.

## Scoring a source for use in Understandings
Understandings are based on taxonomic and nomenclatural works, but not all works are considered equal for use. There are four metrics which should be considered when debating whether or not a piece of work may be considered for usage as the basis for an Understanding. These are:

- Relevant to the geographic area of the Understanding system in question
- Explicitly looked at significant amounts of material from the geographic region
- Published in an open format i.e. not behind paywalls, so that people may use the work
- Contains an identification key to the change so that peer review is possible

Not all works will fit each point. It is up to the organisers of each individual Understanding scheme to rule on a case-by-case basis.

## What to do when you don't know the source
It is frequently, especially for older interpretations, the case that are no works which will meet the above criteria. In such a case, the best resource to use are commonly used identification keys.
