# Rules for Understandings
This document sets out the rules by which Understandings may be created/modified.

## Creations and modifications of Understandings

There are three core operations to Understandings:
- Create
- Split
- Merge



- New entry to the region
    - Entirely new species
    - Arrival of extant species not already in the Understanding remit

## No deletions
An Understanding must never be deleted. Once the Understanding is created and in use, it is permanent. If an Understanding is no longer valid it should be redirected to another as a junior synonym.

### Example
A typo was made, resulting in 'Bombus: iso. Laterielle: 1802'. This was noticed and requires correction. The existing, mis-written, Understanding is not changed. Instead, a new Understanding 'Bombus: iso. Latreille: 1802' is created.

The reason behind this is that, as soon as an Understanding is created and made available for use, *someone* may have used it. As such, that Understanding cannot be deleted. Corrections must be done via the creation of the corrected Understanding and the incorrect synonymised to the new.
