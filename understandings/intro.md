# Understandings
Understandings are a system for the quick and easy use of Regional Interpretations. Understandings have two parts:

- The Understandings Framework that determines how Interpretations are written
- The Understandings System that manages the Understandings

## Writing an Understanding
Understandings do not have one singular format for being written and instead rely on a formatting guide that is implemented in various ways. The reason for this approach is that Understandings, and Interpretations, are still new and undergoing testing. Picking a singular format right at the start, where the use cases for Interpretations are still vague, is unlikely to provide the correct answer for the future. Designing a framework by which others can use and adapt provides room to grow and change as the needs of the users change.

### The Understanding framework
An Understanding requires the following information to be written:

> Name Separator1 Format Author Separator2 Year

This sequence of attributes is designed to strike a compromise between human and machine-readable formats. It is recommended to use punctuation-based separators e.g. `:` to minimise disruption to human reading whilst still providing a unique character for machine reading. Any character or phrase prohibited by the nomenclatural codes is reasonable candidate. Care should be taken to not use common phrases that may appear in names, especially in other languages. Simplicity is likely the correct approach.

> Note that `separator1` and `separator2` may be the same character.

### Default format
The 'default' format that Understandings use is called the 'iso format'. This format was developed alongside Interpretations and Understandings, coming into existence very early on as a means to write a full Interpretation in (relative) shorthand.

`iso` stands for 'In the Sense Of', taking inspiration from the Latin 'sensu'. An iso-format Understanding looks as follows:

> *Bombus lucorum*: iso. Murray et al: 2008

Broken down, we can see the distinct parts mandated by the Understanding framework:

|Attribute|Value|
|---|--|
|Name|*Bombus lucorum*|
|Separator1|:|
|Format|iso.|
|Author|Murray et al|
|Separator2|:|
|Year|2008|

When spoken aloud, this is

> *Bombus lucorum* in the sense of Murray et al, 2008

> End it here, that's enough in one page
>
> Next page goes into the Understandings system
>
> We can now write an Interpretation in one, albeit fairly long, line. This line, according to the principles of Interpretations, carries the entire taxonomic and nomenclatural status in it.

## Regional bounds
> - UK & Ireland
> - Ireland because the Irish taxa for this group is a subset of the UK by geography

## Temporal bounds
> - Utterly impractical to go back to the start
> - Lots of lost data
> - Some recoverable, some not
> - Standard practices hide a *lot* of changes to maintain the illusion of conformity
> - Pick the point where most of the region's data starts to comes from
> - Get as close to that date as possible
> - Modern systems are creating orders of magnitude more data than old
> - Modern nomenclature is the focus (~1960 for BWARS)

## Defined epithet meanings
> - Did not use 's.s.' & 's.l.'
>   - Latin (people don't tend to know Latin)
> - 'agg' for nomenclatural aggregates
> - 'cpx' for human-defined complexes (**not** governed by Understandings System)

## Type vs Interpretation
> - Types need the ICZN to agree to do something
> - Not going to happen quickly, if at all
> - Interpretation-only systems do not have the backing that would make cross-system communication easy
> - They do however allow people to solve nomenclatural disjunctions
> - Cross-system comparison is doable, just slower and manual
> - Have to respond to taxonomic alterations manually
