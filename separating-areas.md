So far, we have identified two instances of a fundamental flaw in Linnaean nomenclature which are leading to divergences between a type and its name. We then proceeded to use standard design methods to provide a standard solution, then used scientific standard practices to turn the engineering solution into a more human-friendly version. However, using the same solution to both problems means that there are two sets of the same versioning attributes. One set applies to the type, the other to the interpretation. What is now required is to provide an easy to use method of distinguishing between uses of the taxonomic and interpretation layers.

## How to distinguish between two identical objects
The simplest way to distinguish between our two objects is to differ in how these are written. We could for instance write:

`Bombus lucorum, Linnaeus, 1761`

`Bombus lucorum, Linnaeus, 1761, TypeVersion [Example, 2025, 1]`

`Bombus lucorum, Linnaeus, 1761, TypeVersion [Example, 2025, 1], Interpretation [Example, 2025, 4]`
