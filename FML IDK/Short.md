# Understandings

## What is an Understanding
An Understanding is a standardised way to include extra information to a taxonomic name so that previously invisible differences can be separated.

## An example situation
The bat *Pipistrelle pipistrellus* was split into two species: *Pipistrelle pipistrellus* and *Pipistrelle pygmaeus*. When attempting to use the name '*Pipistrelle pipistrellus*', for example examine data or read scientific articles, it is impossible to know for sure whether the name refers to the pre or post split version.

## Why is this important
The use of the Linnaean-style nomenclatural system is based upon the idea that multiple people can converse and share data with the assurance that they are all talking about the same thing. This fundamental facet is, demonstrably, untrue.
