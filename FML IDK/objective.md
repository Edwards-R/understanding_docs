# Objective
The objective is to ensure that, at any point in time, anyone, from anywhere, can look at taxonomic data and have complete confidence that they know exactly what they are looking at.

## What counts as exact confidence
If the observer can list the type or, in the case of split taxa, types that a piece of taxonomic information refers to, then the system is working with exact confidence.

## What counts as any time
The system is not allowed to drift out of sync with current taxonomic understanding or definitions over time. Data which has been lost or is not well defined, e.g. prehistoric, fossil record, lost types, may or may not work, based on the amount of information available. If it is at all *possible* to source the data required by the system, the system will work to the best understanding of the people entering the data.

## What counts as anywhere
The system must adapt to regional changes in understanding

## What counts as anyone
Taxonomy is not a unified field. There exists competing ideas of how taxa should be grouped, organised, and stored. The system's objective is to enable a system by which these competing systems can communicate with the minimum loss of information possible.

This *includes* moving between heirarchical Linnaean and phylogenetic nomenclatural systems.
