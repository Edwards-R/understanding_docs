# Rules for Understandings
This document sets out the rules by which Understandings may be created/modified.

## Creations and modifications of Understandings

There are three core operations to Understandings:
- Create
- Split
- Merge

Each operation is treated in a distinct way.

### Create
In order for a `create` operation to be used, there are some critical points. Primarily, the Understanding being created must *not* have been recorded in the region in **any** significant manner. This is especially the case when dealing with new taxa arising from nomenclatural *or* taxonomic splits - these are `split` operations, **not** `create`. The main source of `create` operations will be performed during the establishment of the Understanding system and, once established, for taxa which are *colonising* the area.

### Split
Used whenever an Understanding present in the area is split. This split may be purely nomenclatural *or* taxonomic.

### Merge
Used when multiple Understandings in the area are considered to be one Understanding.

## No deletions
An Understanding must never be deleted. Once the Understanding is created and in use, it is permanent. If an Understanding is no longer valid it should be redirected to another as a junior synonym.

### Example
A typo was made, resulting in 'Bombus: iso. Laterielle: 1802'. This was noticed and requires correction. The existing, mis-written, Understanding is not changed. Instead, a new Understanding 'Bombus: iso. Latreille: 1802' is created.

The reason behind this is that, as soon as an Understanding is created and made available for use, *someone* may have used it. As such, that Understanding cannot be deleted. Corrections must be done via the creation of the corrected Understanding and the incorrect synonymised to the new.
