# Summary
Whilst this documentation removes the ability of a nomenclatural divergence to occur, there are still multiple areas which require further development. The primary focus for futher development is in the creation of a practical implementation of the proposed system so that real-life testing may be performed.

There are multiple problems still to be addressed before a viable system may be considered finalised.

- Interpretations and taxonomic names are written identically whilst referring to very distinct ideas, which is a highly undesirable situation.
- Keeping track of interpretations, type concepts, and type names in a strict manner requires automation, which in turn requires a strict set of rules to be laid out (and for people to follow them).
- The absence of a suitable scheme managing taxonomy for zoology is also a significant impediment to establishing the proposed system, albeit one which can be overcome safely.
- How large (or small) should a region be, and what is to be done if regions overlap/disagree?
