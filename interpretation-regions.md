# Interpretation Regions
Previously, we demonstrated the division of the Linnaean taxonomic system into three components, as well how these components enable the use of regional variation. In this section we will examine a simplified real world scenario which utilises the three component system across two regions to provide precise, modernised, to-type precision of nomenclature.

## Concept vs reality in the face of cryptic taxa

Whilst taxonomy may be global, that global nature is only in concept. In practice, various regions may have differening applications of taxonomy to match their own practical needs. The most obvious example of this regionality is when a region discovers that they harbour a cryptic complex of well-established taxa. To examine *why* regionality exists, as well as the need to accurately handle regionality in order to maximise precision, the next section will walk through a real life example of the discovery of a cryptic taxon. 

## Establishing the participating type components
The participating type names in this exercise are:

|Name|Name Author|Name Year|
|---|:-:|:-:|
|Bombus lucorum|Linnaeus|1761|
|Bombus cryptarum|Fabricius|1775|
|Bombus magnus|Vogt|1911|

Expanding this table allows us to reference the type concept version for each taxon.

> Note that the types and their versions used here are approximated, as precise type concept versioning requires the attention of an experienced taxonomist. Such taxonomically precise versioning would also provide a significant barrier to ease of comprehension, making complexity undesirable in educational examples.

|Name|Author|Year|Concept Author|Concept Year|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Bombus lucorum|Linnaeus|1761|Latreille|1802|
|Bombus cryptarum|Fabricius|1775|Latreille|1802|
|Bombus magnus|Vogt|1911|Vogt|1911|

### A quick note on perfection (and the lack of it)
When establishing a history of the interpretations of any taxon, it is likely that complex situations will emerge. It is also possible that the pertinent information will simply have been lost to time and no-one living remembers what was done and when. For the purpose of this explanation, interpretations given in examples will be simplified versions of reality, so as to not require multiple taxonomic papers to be written (and then read) for each example given.

## The history of interpretation in Great Britain (and Ireland)
Our example starts with the known presence of *Bombus lucorum* (Linnaeus 1761), concept version Latreille 1802.

|Attribute|Value|
|:--|--:|
|Name|*Bombus lucorum*|
|Name author|Linnaeus|
|Name year|1761|
|Concept author|Latreille|
|Concept year|1802|

As the concept version is by Latreille, the initial interpretation for this concept also belongs to Latreille:

|Attribute|Value|
|:--|--:|
|Name|*Bombus lucorum*|
|Name author|Linnaeus|
|Name year|1761|
|Concept author|Latreille|
|Concept year|1802|
|Interpretation author|Latreille|
|Interpretation year|1802|

### Discovery of a cryptic complex
In 2008, Murray et al positively identified a cryptic complex within the Latreille 1802 interpretation of *Bombus lucorum*. This complex included the aforementioned *Bombus lucorum*, but also *Bombus magnus* and *Bombus cryptarum*.

|Attribute|Value|
|:--|--:|
|Name|*Bombus magnus*|
|Name author|Vogt|
|Name year|1911|
|Concept author|Vogt|
|Concept year|1911|

|Attribute|Value|
|:--|--:|
|Name|*Bombus cryptarum*|
|Name author|Fabricius|
|Name year|1775|
|Concept author|Fabricius|
|Concept year|1775|

The three taxonomic concepts (*B. lucorum*, *B. magnus*, & *B. cryptarum*) were, in 2008, well established and in frequent usage. There is therefore a problem: information of *Bombus lucorum*, interpretated according to Latreille in 1802, *from the region of Great Britain* has been found to not correspond or obey the global type concept declared by Latreille in 1802. The situation in Great Britain has reached nomenclatural divergence, yet the wider world is not in nomenclatural divergence.

To solve this, we need to use regionally isolated interpretations to refer to the globally applicable concept versions. Here, the new interpretation results from Murray et al in 2008, providing the following interpretations:

|Attribute|Value|
|:--|--:|
|Name|*Bombus lucorum*|
|Name author|Linnaeus|
|Name year|1761|
|Concept author|Latreille|
|Concept year|1802|
|Interpretation author|Murray et al|
|Interpretation year|2008|

|Attribute|Value|
|:--|--:|
|Name|*Bombus magnus*|
|Name author|Vogt|
|Name year|1911|
|Concept author|Vogt|
|Concept year|1911|
|Interpretation author|Murray et al|
|Interpretation year|2008|

|Attribute|Value|
|:--|--:|
|Name|*Bombus cryptarum*|
|Name author|Fabricius|
|Name year|1775|
|Concept author|Fabricius|
|Concept year|1775|
|Interpretation author|Murray et al|
|Interpretation year|2008|

With this information recorded, we can switch using only the interpretation as a shortcut. Accordingly, this provides us with a list of the interpretations of these three taxa in Great Britain:

|Name|Interpetation author|Interpretation year|
|---|:-:|:-:|
|*Bombus lucorum*|Latreille|1802|
|*Bombus lucorum*|Murray et al|2008|
|*Bombus magnus*|Murray et al|2008|
|*Bombus cryptarum*|Murray et al|2008|

## The history of interpretation in Austria
Following the work of Murray et al, Bossert et al (2016) performed genetic analysis of *Bombus lucorum* in Austria. Their conclusion supported the findings of Murray et al, coming to the conclusion that what was regarded as *B. lucorum* in Austria was a mixture of *B. lucorum* and *B. cryptarum*. *B. magnus* was not present in any of the samples.

## A brief history
> Start point was at Latreille 1802
> Then lucorum and cryptarum in Bossert et al 2016

As before, the first step is to establish the initial position of *Bombus lucorum* and *Bombus cryptarum* in Austria. For the purpose of this explanation, this position is considered to be the same as for Great Britain, where only *Bombus lucorum* was known to occur:

|Attribute|Value|
|:--|--:|
|Name|*Bombus lucorum*|
|Name author|Linnaeus|
|Name year|1761|
|Concept author|Latreille|
|Concept year|1802|
|Interpretation author|Latreille|
|Interpretation year|1802|

From this point, we can apply the findings of Bossert et al to create the new, Austria-specific, interpretations. First, the initial state of the type of Bombus cryptarum is exactly the same as that of Great Britain, as the types are strictly global:

|Attribute|Value|
|:--|--:|
|Name|*Bombus cryptarum*|
|Name author|Fabricius|
|Name year|1775|
|Concept author|Fabricius|
|Concept year|1775|

Since the recognition of *Bombus cryptarum* is a regional event, only the interpretation - which is regionally restricted by design - needs to be modified:

|Attribute|Value|
|:--|--:|
|Name|*Bombus cryptarum*|
|Name author|Fabricius|
|Name year|1775|
|Concept author|Fabricius|
|Concept year|1775|
|Interpretation author|Bossert et al|
|Interpretation year|2016|

When using the interpretation shortcut, we end up with three distinct interpretations:

|Name|Interpetation author|Interpretation year|
|---|:-:|:-:|
|*Bombus lucorum*|Latreille|1802|
|*Bombus lucorum*|Bossert et al|2016|
|*Bombus cryptarum*|Bossert et al|2016|

### Side-by-side analysis
> Side-by-side timeline, with the type author & year, plus TVN, removed (can just look up to the previous table if confused) and replace with `A` for Austria and `B` for UK/IE. The resulting confusion is why the only practical solution is to subdivide responsibility. This is far too confusing to be practically useful in one unified block.
