# Interpretation Regions
Previously, it was established that whilst taxonomy was global, nomenclature was regional. The relationship between taxonomy and nomenclature is now established, but there are questions remaining as to the details of nomencaltural regions. What size is a 'region'? Who should adminster a region? How do we construct a global database from back from these regions? This section will cover these topics, as well as delving a little further into the how and why.

## A worked example
Regional interpretations, as well as how they interact with each other and types, are reasonably straightforward to explain via example. We define the *types* we will use as

|Type|Author|Year|
|---|---|---|
|Bombus lucorum|Linnaeus|1761|
|Bombus cryptarum|Fabricius|1775|
|Bombus magnus|Vogt|1911|

To keep things simple and focused on the interpretations, we will skip any confusion of types, as well as movement of higher taxa, at this point and say that the types are still relevant today as they were described.

|Type Name|Type Author|Type Year|Type Version Author|Type Version Year|Type Version Number|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Bombus lucorum|Linnaeus|1761|Linnaeus|1761|1|
|Bombus cryptarum|Fabricius|1775|Fabricius|1775|1|
|Bombus magnus|Vogt|1911|Vogt|1911|1|

The next step is to choose a scenario in which these type versions were interpreted differently in two different regions. For this, we will use the United Kingdom & Ireland against Austria. These will not be fullly detailed 'from the start' histories, purely to keep the example focused on the exact issue of regional variance.

## Setting the stage
*Bombus lucorum* has been a known 'problem' taxon for a while. For over 200 years there has been debate over whether the taxon is one, two, three, or perhaps more species. The reason for this confusion is that the taxon is morphologically variable while spanning a vast range. What may differ in one region may not in another, and the same in reverse. It was not until the advent of genetic sampling that this confusion, known as a *cryptic complex*, could be unravelled. However, this unravelling has happened at different times in different regions. The complex's components 

### United Kingdom and Ireland
In 2008, Murray et al positively identified a cryptic complex within what was called *Bombus lucorum* at the time. This was done using a wide selection of material from across the United Kingdom and Ireland. The collection material was genetically sampled and matched against previously established material using GenBank to provide a genetic foundation.

### Austria
Following the work of Murray et al, Bossert et al (2016) performed genetic analysis of *Bombus lucorum* in Austria. Their conclusion supported the findings of Murray et al, coming to the conclusion that what was regarded as *B. lucorum* in Austria was a mixture of *B. lucorum* and *B. cryptarum*. *B. magnus* was not present in any of the samples.

### Previous works
As mentioned, we will be cutting short the prior history of the taxa here in order to focus on the regional variation. Whilst each region has their own lead-up to the separation of *B. lucorum*, *B. cryptarum*, and *B. magnus*, that information is not relevant to the immediate lesson.

## What happens now
From our example, we can now construct a set of interpretations for each region. These interpretations are as follows:

### UK & IE
|Type Name|Type Author|Type Year|Type Version Author|Type Version Year|Type Version Number|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|*Bombus lucorum*|Linnaeus|1761|Linnaeus|1761|1|
|*Bombus lucorum*|Linnaeus|1761|Murray et al|2008|1|
|*Bombus cryptarum*|Linnaeus|1761|Murray et al|2008|1|
|*Bombus magnus*|Linnaeus|1761|Murray et al|2008|1|

### Austria
|Type Name|Type Author|Type Year|Type Version Author|Type Version Year|Type Version Number|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|*Bombus lucorum*|Linnaeus|1761|Linnaeus|1761|1|
|*Bombus lucorum*|Linnaeus|1761|Bossert et al|2016|1|
|*Bombus cryptarum*|Linnaeus|1761|Bossert et al|2016|1|
|*Bombus magnus*|Linnaeus|1761|Bossert et al|2016|1|

### Side-by-side analysis
> Side-by-side timeline, with the type author & year, plus TVN, removed (can just look up to the previous table if confused) and replace with `A` for Austria and `B` for UK/IE. The resulting confusion is why the only practical solution is to subdivide responsibility. This is far too confusing to be practically useful in one unified block.
