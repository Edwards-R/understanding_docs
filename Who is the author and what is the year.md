# Who is the author and what is the year?
This document expands on who the author of an Understanding should be, and what the year should be.

## The basics
The simplest way to decide on the author and year is that *these are the author(s) of the work which created the need for a new Understanding, and the year in which it was accepted.

## The best works
The ideal work to base an Understanding on covers all of these key points:
- Is relevant to the geographic area of the Understanding system in question
- Explicitly has looked at significant amounts of material from the geographic region
- Is published in an open format i.e. not behind paywalls, so that people may use the work
- Contains an identification key to the change so that peer review is possible

# Examples

## Bombus lucorum, Murray et al 2008

### Input
- Bombus lucorum: iso. Sladen: 1912

### Output
- Bombus lucorum: iso. Murray et al: 2008
- Bombus cryptarum: iso. Murray et al: 2008
- Bombus magnus: iso. Murray et al: 2008
- Bombus lucorum agg: iso. Murray et al: 2008

## Scoring
|Trait|Score|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|Relevant area|Yes||
|Material|Yes|Multiple specimens from the area specifically sourced and used|
|Open format|**No**|Locked behind paywalls so users cannot access without significant financial burden or membership to a appropriate institution|
|Contains key|Yes|ID only possible in area via genetic or chemical markers|

## Explanation
Murray et al, in 2008, demonstrated that what was known as *Bombus lucorum* iso. Sladen: 1912, in Great Britain and Ireland, was indeed a composition of three identifiable species.
