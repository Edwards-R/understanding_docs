# Introduction
The Linnaean taxonomic system is a means of classifying life using a fixed number of categories, known as ranks. It was first published in Carl Linnaeus's 'Systema Naturae' in 1735. The taxonomic system has been refined multiple times since its inception, though this refinement has been predominantly in the realm of deciding where the boundaries should be placed amongst groups. Far less refinement has gone into the architecture of the final system, which exists much in the same way that Carl Linnaeus first created it.

However, there are significant errors in the design which result in drastically reduced accuracy. One of the most problematic aspects of the original system created by Linnaeus was the idea that everything had a given 'true form' that man would inherently recognise. Whilst not a surprising viewpoint from the era, the assumption has caused numerous difficulties ever since its inception. Crucially to this work, the idea of a true form meant that Linnaeaus never imagined a system in which change from this 'true form' was even *possible*. Change, however, is *inevitable* - at least at this point in our understanding of the natural world. Maybe in the future we will have an ironclad perfect system in which every living organism may be classified without concern of error, but such a system is far, far into the future - if it will ever arrive.

With change inevitable, and a perfect, rigid, system implausible, what is to be done? To follow an engineer's quote: *perfection is the enemy of progress* - and progress is certainly possible. By utilising some well-understood and developed ideas from the discipline of system architecture, we can identify exactly where the Linnaean system fails to handle change, isolate the fault, and insert a solution. Whilst such a solution will induce *some* change to how users interact with the Linnaean taxonomic system, the true amount of change is incredibly minor. Crucially, the changes will still obey the vast majority of the nomenclatural codes, and the vast majority of our current taxonomic knowledge may be preserved and utilised. Indeed, our current taxonomic knowledge will be *enhanced* by these changes to the underlying system, allowing us to utilise them with far greater accuracy than before.

The first step is, as previously stated, to identify *where* the error occurs. To do that, we need to examine the idea of *nomenclatural divergence*.
