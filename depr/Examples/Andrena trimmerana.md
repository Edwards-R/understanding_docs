## Andrena trimmerana worked example

The start of the relevant section in the source paper is found on the 5th page (pg 396 of the journal), titled '*History of the names applied to the* Andrena trimmerana *complex*'. The paper opens with *Andrena trimmerana* (Kirby, 1802) and *Andrena spinigera* (Kirby, 1802). In order to not overload the reader with additional complexity and maintain parity with the text in the article, these will be known as:

- *Andrena trimmerana*: iso. Kirby: 1802
- *Andrena spinigera*: iso. Kirby: 1802

We then encounter *Andrena dragana: iso. Friese: 1887*, which for the purpose of Understandings is considered deprecated without a sponsor. A deprecated Understanding is one which shows up as the type, but is never used. Being 'deprecated without a sponsor' refers to the fact that no specific work was done to deprecate the Understanding. Rather the Understanding was simply not agreed upon by the community and never used.

Following on, Alfken *alters the Understanding* of *Andrena trimmerana*: iso. Kirby: 1802 by assigning *A. trimmerana* as being univoltine. This gives reflexive rise to a new Understanding:

- *Andrena trimmerana*: iso. Alfken: 1911

> Note that Wood et al are creating a 'generic' version of the nomenclature, which neccessitates following one out of the many avenues of development of these taxa. Later sections will detail the GB-specific modifications to nomenclature and understanding.

Alfken then splits *Andrena spinigera*: iso. Kirby: 1802 into

- *Andrena spinigera*: iso. Alfken: 1911
- *Andrena anglica*: iso. Alfken: 1911

Perkins continues in this vein, using all three taxa in the sense of Alfken, 1911. His recognition of a variant within *Andrena trimmerana*: iso. Alfken: 1911 is best placed as a 'sub-species' within Understandings:

- *Andrena trimmerana scotica*: iso. Perkins: 1916

Perkins, one year later, synonymises the following:

- *Andrena trimmerana*: iso. Alfken: 1911
- *Andrena spinigera*: iso. Alfken: 1911
- *Andrena anglica*: iso. Alfken: 1911

into

- *Andrena trimmerana*: iso. Perkins: 1917

In 1927, Perkins splits *Andrena trimmerana*: iso. Perkins: 1917 to form

- *Andrena trimmerana*: iso. Perkins: 1921
- *Andrena jacobi*: iso. Perkins: 1921

The next operation is by Warnke in 1967, who synonymises *Andrena jacobi*: iso. Perkins: 1921 with a previously unmentioned Understanding of *Andrena carantonica*. The result is

- *Andrena carantonica*: iso. Warnke: 1967

This Understanding exists alongside

- *Andrena trimmerana*: iso. Perkins: 1921

Following this, Warnke moves *Andrena trimmerana*: iso. Perkins: 1921 to be a junior synonym of a previously unmentioned *Andrena sabulosa*, generating

- *Andrena sabulosa*: iso. Warnke: 1986

This Understanding is not used by the entomological community, relegating the name to deprecation without a sponsor. Accordingly, the Understanding *Andrena trimmerana*: iso. Perkins: 1927 continues to be in major use.

Warnke makes allusion to elevating *Andrena trimmerana scotica*: iso. Perkins: 1916 to a species under *Andrena carantonica*: iso. Warnke: 1967, but never does so. However, Schwarz completes this work in 1996, creating

- *Andrena carantonica*: iso. Schwartz: 1996

At this point the current nomenclature is as follows:

- *Andrena trimmerana*: iso. Perkins: 1927
- *Andrena carantonica*: iso. Schwartz: 1996

Wood et al then demonstrate that the name *Andrena scotica* has precedence over *Andrena carantonica*, creating

- *Andrena scotica*: iso. Wood et al: 2022

## Meanwhile, in Great Britain
Never shy of adding problems to problems, Great Britain (and indeed other individuals across Europe) have significantly deviated from the above format. The significant, known, deviation starts with Perkins in 1921. In the exact same paper that split *Andrena trimmerana*: iso. Perkins: 1917 into *Andrena trimmerana*: iso. Perkins: 1921 and *Andrena jacobi*: iso. Perkins: 1921, Perkins specifically redirects *Andrena trimmerana scotica*: Perkins: 1917 to be *Andrena jacobi*: iso. Perkins: 1921. This is the same change that Warnke made, with the addition that Warnke synonymised this under *Andrena carantonica*. Many people disagreed with Warnke, for a host of reasons. Notably, Warnke was consistently lax with utilising type specimens, tending to rely purely on a description written entirely in Latin.

As a result, Great Britain (and Ireland by proxy) used the following interpretations:

- *Andrena trimmerana*: iso. Perkins: 1921
- *Andrena jacobi*: iso. Perkins: 1921

In 2018 Else & Edwards, working in conjunction with Wood on this topic, publish a work which utilises *Andrena scotica* as the correct name for *Andrena jacobi*: iso. Perkins: 1921. Notably, this book *only* addresses a limited geographic area as it is primarily a key to identification. For said limited area, the changes are widely accepted, giving

- *Andrena trimmerana*: iso. Perkins: 1921
- *Andrena scotica*: iso. Else & Edwards: 2018

Following this, Wood et al, working in conjunction with Edwards, publish the titular paper '*Andrena scotica* Perkins is the the valid name for the widespread European taxon previously referred to as *Andrena carantonica* Perez (Hymenoptera: Andrenidae)' in 2022. This paper confirms the change of *Andrena jacobi* and *Andrena carantonica* to *Andrena scotica*, therefore there are no changes made at this point.

*However*, there was a complication. Andrena are notorious for their ability to adapt and change what were once thought of as fixed lifestyle patterns. Determination, specifically the separation, of *Andrena trimmerana*: iso. Perkins: 1921 and *Andrena scotica*: iso. Else & Edwards: 2018 relied partially on one taxon being univoltine (one flight period per year) and the other being bivoltine (two flight periods per year). The other key character was a spike on the mandible (jaw). When Wood et al performed genetic testing, it was found that these methods of separation were *not* conclusive. Entomologists were identifying specimens to be one of the pair, while full genome testing assigned the specimen to the other side. As such, there was significant and widespread confusion in the extant body of specimens - including material derived from these such as digital records. As such, *Andrena trimmerana*: iso. Perkins: 1921 and *Andrena scotica*: iso. Else & Edwards: 2018 are considered to be an aggregate of the two species.

Putting the final stage together gives us the following three interpretations:

- *Andrena trimmerana*: iso. Wood et al: 2022
- *Andrena scotica*: iso. Wood et al: 2022
- *Andrena scotica agg*: iso. Wood et al: 2022

All material in Great Britain prior to Wood et al: 2022, *other* than the exact original type specimens themselves, must be regarded as *Andrena scotica agg*: iso. Wood et al: 2022. As of 2022 to date (2024), only material determined using full genome sequencing can be assigned to *Andrena trimmerana*: iso. Wood et al: 2022 or *Andrena scotica*: iso. Wood et al: 2022.
