# Example Understandings: Pipestrelle
This document utilises the split in *Pipistrellus pipistrellus* to give an example of how Understandings work in ISO format. All Understandings are taken from a GB context. Remember that Understandings are, by definition, regional, and need to be resolved back to type for comparison across regions.

## Details
*Pipistrellus pipistrellus* in GB was identified to be a composite of two distinct species.

The original Understanding has, so far as a non-specialist can find, been lost to taxonomic prehistory. As such, a modern system would likely infer the original Understanding based on works such as a common key. For the purpose of this example, we will revert to the Understanding created when Kaup declared the genus *Pipistrellus*:

- *Pipistrellus pipistrellus: iso. Kaup: 1829*.

The splitting of the taxon took place over a number of years, as many cryptic species do, culminating in [genetic investigation (paywalled)](https://doi.org/10.1038/387138b0) which confirmed the suspected separation into:

- *Pipistrellus pipistrellus*
- *Pipistrellus pygmaeus*

The authors of the paper, in the order that they appear on the paper, are:

- E.M. Barrat
- R. Deaville
- T.M. Burland
- M.W. Bruford
- G. Jones
- P.A. Racey
- R.K. Wayne

As there are *more than two* names, the reference is written as '*first author* et al':

- Barrat et al

The year of publication of this paper is 1997. Following the standard for splits, this leads to the creation of a new Understanding per involve taxon, plus the aggregate:

- *Pipistrellus pipistrellus: iso. Barrat et al: 1997*
- *Pipistrellus pygmaeus: iso. Barrat et al: 1997*
- *Pipistrellus pipistrellus agg: iso. Barrat et al: 1997*

## Notes on the subject paper
The paper used in this understanding is far from perfect. At no point does it make note of the species that the split resulted in, which had to be sourced from other places. However, the paper is the defining of 'a separate group' and therefore counts as the source of an Understanding - even if incomplete. An taxon expert may well be able to point to an earlier paper which simply has passed me by when attempting to conduct investigation. Indeed, the entire search to find the story of the name has been a delve into fairly 'lost' information. Not in the least due to the paywall that this paper sits behind.
